This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not apply to other websites to which we link. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
<br>
<br>1) Information Collected
<br>
<br>We collect two types of information from you: i) information that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. through a voluntary registration process, sign-ups or emails); and ii) information that is derived through automated tracking mechanisms.
<br>
<br>· Voluntary Registration Information.
<br>
<br>In order to fully access this Site, you must first complete the registration process, during which we will collect personal information about you. The information will include your name, address, and email address and any other personal or detailed information about yourself that will be shown in your personal profile. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide such information to us on a voluntary basis such as through our opt in newsletter.

<br>
<br>· Cookies
<br>
<br>Our site uses “cookies” and other tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user’s system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user’s information while they are away from their computer.
<br>
<br>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Site.

<br>the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for which we use your information and with whom such information is shared;
<br>
<br>in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists where we disclose:

<br>
<br>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.

<br>
<br>The right to request the deletion of your personal information
<br>
<br>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Website, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).

<br>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.
<br>
<br>How to exercise your rights
<br>
<br>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.
<br>
<br>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:
<br>
<br>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
<br>
<br>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
<br>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.
<br>
<br>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.
<br>
<br>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.
<br>
<br>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.
<br>
<br>How and when we are expected to handle your request
<br>
<br>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.
<br>
<br>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
<br>
<br>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.
<br>
<br>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.
<br>
<br>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.
